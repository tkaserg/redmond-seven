This is a study of a `GTK-2.0` and `GTK-3.20` theme aiming to mimic the classic gray theme from Windows 7. It is a minimal theme written from scratch completely. For that reason, some elements may be unstyled and therefore look ugly.

This theme has been developed on `Debian` with `Mate Desktop` and tested on most of the default-installed applications and on `gtk3-widget-factory` as well. On the contrary, this theme was not tested on another desktop environments. If you are interested in extending support to any other desktop environment, do not create a feature request but implement it and send me a pull request to merge.

The theme does support `GTK-3.20` but not the older `GTK-3.*` versions.
