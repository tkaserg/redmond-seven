This is a study of a `GTK-2.0` and `GTK-3.20` theme aiming to mimic the classic gray theme from Windows 7. It is a minimal theme written from scratch completely. For that reason, some elements may not be styled and look ugly. Also, this theme has been developed on `Mate Desktop` and not tested elsewhere so some application may not look good.
